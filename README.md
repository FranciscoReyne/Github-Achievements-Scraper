# GitHub Achievements Scraper



## ðŸ”¹ Plan of Action  
To unlock GitHub achievements we need to identify which ones exist and what actions trigger them. Then, we can automate these actions using Python.

### List of some Achievements and How to Unlock Them  
| **Achievement**        | **How to unlock it** |

| **Mars 2020 Contributor** | Contribute to repositories related to the Mars Rover. |
| **Galaxy Brain** | Create a discussion with 5 marked solutions. |
| **Pull Shark** | Have multiple pull requests merged. |
| **YOLO** | Merge a PR without review. |
| **Pair Extraordinaire** | Co-author a commit. |
| **Galaxy Brain** | Answer questions in GitHub Discussions. |

| **Achievement**          | **How to Unlock It**                                                                                 | **How to Automate with Python** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Quickdraw**           | Close an issue or pull request within 5 minutes of opening it.                                     | Use `PyGithub` to programmatically open and close issues or pull requests within 5 minutes. |
| **Starstruck**          | Create a repository that receives at least 16 stars.                                              | Develop an attractive project and promote it. Automating star collection is against GitHub's policies and is not recommended. |
| **Pair Extraordinaire** | Co-author commits in a merged pull request.                                                       | Use `GitPython` to create commits with multiple authors and submit a pull request containing them. |
| **Pull Shark**          | Open pull requests that get merged.                                                               | Use `PyGithub` to create and submit pull requests to specific repositories. Ensure they are valid and useful so they get merged. |
| **Galaxy Brain**        | Provide answers in GitHub Discussions that are marked as accepted solutions.                      | Automating participation in GitHub Discussions is unethical and against GitHubâ€™s policies. It is recommended to participate manually and provide valuable answers. |
| **YOLO**                | Merge a pull request without a prior review.                                                      | Use `PyGithub` to create and merge your own pull requests without review. However, this is not recommended in collaborative projects. |
| **Public Sponsor**      | Sponsor another developer publicly through GitHub Sponsors.                                       | Automating financial sponsorship is not possible since it involves monetary transactions and personal decisions. |
| **Mars 2020 Contributor** | Contribute to repositories supporting NASAâ€™s Mars 2020 mission.                                  | Identify and manually contribute to Mars 2020-related repositories. Automating contributions may not be effective or ethical. |
| **Arctic Code Vault Contributor** | Contribute to public repositories before February 2020.                                 | This achievement is time-limited and can no longer be obtained. |

**Important Notes**:

- **Automating certain actions on GitHub may violate [GitHubâ€™s Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-acceptable-use-policies)**. Ensure that any automation complies with these policies and does not constitute abuse or unethical behavior.
- **Many GitHub achievements are designed to encourage genuine participation and collaboration**. While automation is technically possible for some, it is strongly recommended to earn them organically.
