# GitHub Achievements ScraperðŸ’¡ 



## ðŸ”¹ Plan of Action  
To unlock all GitHub achievements, we need to identify which ones exist and what actions trigger them. Then, we can automate these actions using Python.

### ðŸŽ– List of Achievements and How to Unlock Them  
| **Achievement**        | **How to unlock it** |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|

| **Mars 2020 Contributor** | Contribute to repositories related to the Mars Rover. |
| **Galaxy Brain** | Create a discussion with 5 marked solutions. |
| **Pull Shark** | Have multiple pull requests merged. |

| **Pair Extraordinaire** | Co-author a commit. |
| **Galaxy Brain** | Answer questions in GitHub Discussions. |

### ðŸ”¹ Automating with Python  
Create a script that:  
âœ… **Creates and contributes to public repositories automatically.**  
âœ… **Submits and auto-merges PRs** (for Pull Shark & YOLO).  
âœ… **Generates commits with co-authors.**  
âœ… **Creates and responds to discussions for Galaxy Brain.**  
âœ… **Automatically stars your own repositories.**  

**Lets write a Python bot for any of these tasks. ðŸš€
